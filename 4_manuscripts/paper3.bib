  abstract = {The problem of estimating causal effects of treatments from observational data falls beyond the realm of supervised learning \{\textemdash\} because counterfactual data is inaccessible, we can never observe the true causal effects. In the absence of "supervision", how can we evaluate the performance of causal inference methods? In this paper, we use influence functions \{\textemdash\} the functional derivatives of a loss function \{\textemdash\} to develop a model validation procedure that estimates the estimation error of causal inference methods. Our procedure utilizes a Taylor-like expansion to approximate the loss function of a method on a given dataset in terms of the influence functions of its loss on a "synthesized", proximal dataset with known causal effects. Under minimal regularity assumptions, we show that our procedure is consistent and efficient. Experiments on 77 benchmark datasets show that using our procedure, we can accurately predict the comparative performances of state-of-the-art causal inference methods applied to a given observational study.},

  abstract = {Prognostic models are used in medicine for investigating patient outcome in relation to patient and disease characteristics. Such models do not always work well in practice, so it is widely recommended that they need to be validated. The idea of validating a prognostic model is generally taken to mean establishing that it works satisfactorily for patients other than those from whose data it was derived. In this paper we examine what is meant by validation and review why it is necessary. We consider how to validate a model and suggest that it is desirable to consider two rather different aspects \textendash{} statistical and clinical validity \textendash{} and examine some general approaches to validation. We illustrate the issues using several case studies. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

We derive a solution that is purely discriminative: neither training nor test distribution are modeled explicitly. The problem of learning under covariate shift can be written as an integrated optimization problem. Instantiating the general optimization problem leads to a kernel logistic regression and an exponential model classifier for covariate shift. The optimization problem is convex under certain conditions; our findings also clarify the relationship to the known kernel mean matching procedure. We report on experiments on problems of spam filtering, text classification, and landmine detection.},

The cohort will be selected from six US field centers. Approximately 38\% of the cohort will be White, 28\% African-American, 23\% Hispanic, and 11\% Asian (of Chinese descent). Baseline measurements will include measurement of coronary calcium using computed tomography; measurement of ventricular mass and function using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging; measurement of flow-mediated brachial artery endothelial vasodilation, carotid intimal-medial wall thickness, and distensibility of the carotid arteries using ultrasonography; measurement of peripheral vascular disease using ankle and brachial blood pressures; electrocardiography; and assessments of microalbuminuria, standard CVD risk factors, sociodemographic factors, life habits, and psychosocial factors. Blood samples will be assayed for putative biochemical risk factors and stored for use in nested case-control studies. DNA will be extracted and lymphocytes will be immortalized for genetic studies. Measurement of selected subclinical disease indicators and risk factors will be repeated for the study of progression over 7 years. Participants will be followed through 2008 for identification and characterization of CVD events, including acute myocardial infarction and other coronary heart disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, and congestive heart failure; therapeutic interventions for CVD; and mortality.},

  abstract = {Skepticism about the assumption of no unmeasured confounding, also known as exchangeability, is often warranted in making causal inferences from observational data; because exchangeability hinges on an investigator's ability to accurately measure covariates that capture all potential sources of confounding. In practice, the most one can hope for is that covariate measurements are at best proxies of the true underlying confounding mechanism operating in a given observational study. In this paper, we consider the framework of proximal causal inference introduced by Tchetgen Tchetgen et al. (2020), which while explicitly acknowledging covariate measurements as imperfect proxies of confounding mechanisms, offers an opportunity to learn about causal effects in settings where exchangeability on the basis of measured covariates fails. We make a number of contributions to proximal inference including (i) an alternative set of conditions for nonparametric proximal identification of the average treatment effect; (ii) general semiparametric theory for proximal estimation of the average treatment effect including efficiency bounds for key semiparametric models of interest; (iii) a characterization of proximal doubly robust and locally efficient estimators of the average treatment effect. Moreover, we provide analogous identification and efficiency results for the average treatment effect on the treated. Our approach is illustrated via simulation studies and a data application on evaluating the effectiveness of right heart catheterization in the intensive care unit of critically ill patients.},

Observations over multiple intervals are pooled into a single sample and a logistic regression is employed to relate the risk factors to the occurrence of the event. We show that this pooled logistic regression is close to the time dependent covariate Cox regression analysis. Numerical examples covering a variety of sample sizes and proportions of events display the closeness of this relationship in situations typical of the Framingham Study.

  abstract = {The accuracy of a prediction algorithm depends on contextual factors that may vary across deployment settings. To address this inherent limitation of prediction, we propose an approach to counterfactual prediction based on the g-formula to predict risk across populations that differ in their distribution of treatment strategies. We apply this to predict 5-year risk of mortality among persons receiving care for HIV in the U.S. Veterans Health Administration under different hypothetical treatment strategies. First, we implement a conventional approach to develop a prediction algorithm in the observed data and show how the algorithm may fail when transported to new populations with different treatment strategies. Second, we generate counterfactual data under different treatment strategies and use it to assess the robustness of the original algorithm's performance to these differences and to develop counterfactual prediction algorithms. We discuss how estimating counterfactual risks under a particular treatment strategy is more challenging than conventional prediction as it requires the same data, methods, and unverifiable assumptions as causal inference. However, this may be required when the alternative assumption of constant treatment patterns across deployment settings is unlikely to hold and new data is not yet available to retrain the algorithm.},

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Simulations were performed based on two normally distributed predictors, a binary outcome, and a binary treatment, mimicking a randomized trial or an observational study. Comparison was made between simply ignoring treatment (SIT), restricting the analytical data set to untreated individuals (AUT), inverse probability weighting (IPW), and explicit modeling of treatment (MT). Methods were compared in terms of predictive performance of the model and the proportion of incorrect treatment decisions. RESULTS: Omitting a genuine predictor of the outcome from the prognostic model decreased model performance, in both an observational study and a randomized trial. In randomized trials, the proportion of incorrect treatment decisions was smaller when applying AUT or MT, compared to SIT and IPW. In observational studies, MT was superior to all other methods regarding the proportion of incorrect treatment decisions. CONCLUSION: If a prognostic model aims to produce correct probabilities of the outcome in the absence of treatment, ignoring treatments that affect that outcome can lead to suboptimal model performance and incorrect treatment decisions. Explicitly, modeling treatment is recommended.},

  abstract = {Multivariable regression models are powerful tools that are used frequently in studies of clinical outcomes. These models can use a mixture of categorical and continuous variables and can handle partially observed (censored) responses. However, uncritical application of modelling techniques can result in models that poorly fit the dataset at hand, or, even more likely, inaccurately predict outcomes on new subjects. One must know how to measure qualities of a model's fit in order to avoid poorly fitted or overfitted models. Measurement of predictive accuracy can be difficult for survival time data in the presence of censoring. We discuss an easily interpretable index of predictive discrimination as well as methods for assessing calibration of predicted survival probabilities. Both types of predictive accuracy should be unbiasedly validated using bootstrapping or cross-validation, before using predictions in a new data series. We discuss some of the hazards of poorly fitted and overfitted regression models and present one modelling strategy that avoids many of the problems discussed. The methods described are applicable to all regression models, but are particularly needed for binary, ordinal, and time-to-event outcomes. Methods are illustrated with a survival analysis in prostate cancer using Cox regression.},

If covariates that are associated with model performance, as measured by the AUC, have a different distribution in the source and target populations, then AUC estimators that only use data from the source population will not reflect model performance in the target population. Here, we provide identification results for the AUC in the target population when outcome and covariate data are available from the sample of the source population, but only covariate data are available from the sample of the target population. In this setting, we propose three estimators for the AUC in the target population and show that they are consistent and asymptotically normal. We evaluate the finite-sample performance of the estimators using simulations and use them to estimate the AUC in a nationally representative target population from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey for a lung cancer risk prediction model developed using source population data from the National Lung Screening Trial.},

A subset of the regressors may be missing for some study subjects either by design or happenstance. In this article we propose a new class of semiparametric estimators, based on inverse probability weighted estimating equations, that are consistent for parameter vector {$\alpha$}\textsubscript{0} of the conditional mean model when the data are missing at random in the sense of Rubin and the missingness probabilities are either known or can be parametrically modeled. We show that the asymptotic variance of the optimal estimator in our class attains the semiparametric variance bound for the model by first showing that our estimation problem is a special case of the general problem of parameter estimation in an arbitrary semiparametric model in which the data are missing at random and the probability of observing complete data is bounded away from 0, and then deriving a representation for the efficient score, the semiparametric variance bound, and the influence function of any regular, asymptotically linear estimator in this more general estimation problem. Because the optimal estimator depends on the unknown probability law generating the data, we propose locally and globally adaptive semiparametric efficient estimators. We compare estimators in our class with previously proposed estimators. We show that each previous estimator is asymptotically equivalent to some, usually inefficient, estimator in our class. This equivalence is a consequence of a proposition stating that every regular asymptotic linear estimator of {$\alpha$}\textsubscript{0} is asymptotically equivalent to some estimator in our class. We compare various estimators in a small simulation study and offer some practical recommendations.},

When a risk factor determines subsequent exposure and is determined by previous exposure, standard analyses that estimate age-specific mortality rates as a function of cumulative exposure can underestimate the true effect of exposure on mortality, whether or not one adjusts for the risk factor in the analysis.

In answer, we offer a graphical approach to the identification and estimation of causal parameters in mortality studies with sustained exposure periods.

We find an adverse effect of arsenic exposure on all cause and lung cancer mortality, which standard methods failed to detect.

This observation raises the question, which if any population parameters can be given a causal interpretation in observational mortality studies? In answer, we offer a graphical approach to the identification and computation of causal parameters in mortality studies with sustained exposure periods. This approach is shown to be equivalent to an approach in which the observational study is identified with a hypothetical double-blind randomized trial in which data on each subject's assigned treatment protocol has been erased from the data file. Causal inferences can then be made by comparing mortality as a function of treatment protocol, since, in a double-blind randomized trial missing data on treatment protocol, the association of mortality with treatment protocol can still be estimated.

If, conditional on the history of the observed data up to t, the hazard of dropping out of the study (i.e., censoring) at time t does not depend on the possibly unobserved data subsequent to t, we say drop-out is ignorable or explainable (Rubin, 1976). On the other hand, if the hazard of drop-out depends on the possibly unobserved future, we say drop-out is non-ignorable or, equivalently, that there is selection bias on unobservables. Neither the existence of selection bias on unobservables nor its magnitude is identifiable from the joint distribution of the observables. In view of this fact, we argue that the data analyst should conduct a ``sensitivity analysis'' to quantify how one's inference concerning an outcome of interest varies as a function of the magnitude of non-identifiable selection bias.},

For instance, if I choose not to treat this patient, are they likely to die? Practitioners commonly use supervised learning algorithms to fit predictive models that help decision-makers reason about likely future outcomes, but we show that this approach is unreliable, and sometimes even dangerous. The key issue is that supervised learning algorithms are highly sensitive to the policy used to choose actions in the training data, which causes the model to capture relationships that do not generalize. We propose using a different learning objective that predicts counterfactuals instead of predicting outcomes under an existing action policy as in supervised learning. To support decision-making in temporal settings, we introduce the Counterfactual Gaussian Process (CGP) to predict the counterfactual future progression of continuous-time trajectories under sequences of future actions. We demonstrate the benefits of the CGP on two important decision-support tasks: risk prediction and ``what if?'' reasoning for individualized treatment planning.},

A given treatment (e.g. a drug or advertisement) should be administered only to those who will respond most positively, and certainly not to those who will be harmed by it. Individual-level treatment effects can be estimated with tools adapted from machine learning, but different models can yield contradictory estimates. Unlike risk prediction models, however, treatment effect models cannot be easily evaluated against each other using a held-out test set because the true treatment effect itself is never directly observed. Besides outcome prediction accuracy, several metrics that can leverage held-out data to evaluate treatment effects models have been proposed, but they are not widely used. We provide a didactic framework that elucidates the relationships between the different approaches and compare them all using a variety of simulations of both randomized and observational data. Our results show that researchers estimating heterogenous treatment effects need not limit themselves to a single model-fitting algorithm. Instead of relying on a single method, multiple models fit by a diverse set of algorithms should be evaluated against each other using an objective function learned from the validation set. The model minimizing that objective should be used for estimating the individual treatment effect for future individuals.},

  abstract = {Clinical prediction models (CPMs) can inform decision making about treatment initiation, which requires predicted risks assuming no treatment is given. However, this is challenging since CPMs are usually derived using data sets where patients received treatment, often initiated postbaseline as ``treatment drop-ins.'' This study proposes the use of marginal structural models (MSMs) to adjust for treatment drop-in. We illustrate the use of MSMs in the CPM framework through simulation studies that represent randomized controlled trials and real-world observational data and the example of statin initiation for cardiovascular disease prevention. The simulations include a binary treatment and a covariate, each recorded at two timepoints and having a prognostic effect on a binary outcome. The bias in predicted risk was examined in a model ignoring treatment, a model fitted on treatment-na\"ive patients (at baseline), a model including baseline treatment, and the MSM. In all simulation scenarios, all models except the MSM underestimated the risk of outcome given absence of treatment. These results were supported in the statin initiation example, which showed that ignoring statin initiation postbaseline resulted in models that significantly underestimated the risk of a cardiovascular disease event occurring within 10 years. Consequently, CPMs that do not acknowledge treatment drop-in can lead to underallocation of treatment. In conclusion, when developing CPMs to predict treatment-na\"ive risk, researchers should consider using MSMs to adjust for treatment drop-in, and also seek to exploit the ability of MSMs to allow estimation of individual treatment effects.},

We discuss how to tailor the prediction model for use in the target population, how to assess model performance in the target population (e.g., by estimating the target population mean squared error), and how to perform model and tuning parameter selection in the context of the target population. We provide identifiability results for the target population mean squared error of a potentially misspecified prediction model under a sampling design where the source study and the target population samples are obtained separately. We also introduce the concept of prediction error modifiers that can be used to reason about the need for tailoring measures of model performance to the target population and provide an illustration of the methods using simulated data.},

  abstract = {The performance of prediction models can be assessed using a variety of methods and metrics. Traditional measures for binary and survival outcomes include the Brier score to indicate overall model performance, the concordance (or c) statistic for discriminative ability (or area under the receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve), and goodness-of-fit statistics for calibration. Several new measures have recently been proposed that can be seen as refinements of discrimination measures, including variants of the c statistic for survival, reclassification tables, net reclassification improvement (NRI), and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI). Moreover, decision\textemdash analytic measures have been proposed, including decision curves to plot the net benefit achieved by making decisions based on model predictions. We aimed to define the role of these relatively novel approaches in the evaluation of the performance of prediction models. For illustration, we present a case study of predicting the presence of residual tumor versus benign tissue in patients with testicular cancer (n = 544 for model development, n = 273 for external validation). We suggest that reporting discrimination and calibration will always be important for a prediction model. Decision-analytic measures should be reported if the predictive model is to be used for clinical decisions. Other measures of performance may be warranted in specific applications, such as reclassification metrics to gain insight into the value of adding a novel predictor to an established model.},

  abstract = {The deployment of machine learning (ML) and statistical models is beginning to transform the practice of healthcare, with models now able to help clinicians diagnose conditions like pneumonia and skin cancer, and to predict which hospital patients are at risk of adverse events such as septic shock. A major concern, however, is that model performance is heavily tied to details particular to the dataset the model was developed on\textemdash even slight deviations from the training conditions can result in wildly different performance. For example, when researchers trained a model to diagnose pneumonia from chest X-rays using data from one health system, but evaluated on data from an external health system, they found the model performed significantly worse than it did internally (Zech and others, 2018). The model failed to generalize (i.e., predict accurately) due to the shifts between the training conditions (health system one) and the deployment/testing conditions (health system two). These shifts are very common when moving a model from the training phase to deployment and can take a variety of forms, including changes in patient demographics, disease prevalence, measurement timing, equipment, treatment patterns, and more. Beyond contributing to poor performance, failing to account for shifts can also lead to dangerous decisions in practice: the system can fail to diagnose severely ill patients or recommend harmful treatments. This problem of shifting conditions which prevent generalization is referred to as dataset shift (Qui\~nonero-Candela and others, 2009), and in this article, we explain what it is, why it occurs, give an overview of the types of existing solutions, and discuss open challenges that remain.},

  abstract = {A common assumption in supervised learning is that the input points in the training set follow the same probability distribution as the input points that will be given in the future test phase. However, this assumption is not satisfied, for example, when the outside of the training region is extrapolated. The situation where the training input points and test input points follow different distributions while the conditional distribution of output values given input points is unchanged is called the covariate shift. Under the covariate shift, standard model selection techniques such as cross validation do not work as desired since its unbiasedness is no longer maintained. In this paper, we propose a new method called importance weighted cross validation (IWCV), for which we prove its unbiasedness even under the covariate shift. The IWCV procedure is the only one that can be applied for unbiased classification under covariate shift, whereas alternatives to IWCV exist for regression. The usefulness of our proposed method is illustrated by simulations, and furthermore demonstrated in the brain-computer interface, where strong non-stationarity effects can be seen between training and test sessions.},

  abstract = {A standard assumption for causal inference from observational data is that one has measured a sufficiently rich set of covariates to ensure that within covariate strata, subjects are exchangeable across observed treatment values. Skepticism about the exchangeability assumption in observational studies is often warranted because it hinges on investigators' ability to accurately measure covariates capturing all potential sources of confounding. Realistically, confounding mechanisms can rarely if ever, be learned with certainty from measured covariates. One can therefore only ever hope that covariate measurements are at best proxies of true underlying confounding mechanisms operating in an observational study, thus invalidating causal claims made on basis of standard exchangeability conditions. Causal learning from proxies is a challenging inverse problem which has to date remained unresolved. In this paper, we introduce a formal potential outcome framework for proximal causal learning, which while explicitly acknowledging covariate measurements as imperfect proxies of confounding mechanisms, offers an opportunity to learn about causal effects in settings where exchangeability on the basis of measured covariates fails. Sufficient conditions for nonparametric identification are given, leading to the proximal g-formula and corresponding proximal g-computation algorithm for estimation. These may be viewed as generalizations of Robins' foundational g-formula and g-computation algorithm, which account explicitly for bias due to unmeasured confounding. Both point treatment and time-varying treatment settings are considered, and an application of proximal g-computation of causal effects is given for illustration.},

Analogous to the estimand framework recently proposed by the European Medicines Agency for clinical trials, we propose a `predictimand' framework of different questions that may be of interest when predicting risk in relation to treatment started after baseline. We provide a formal definition of the estimands matching these questions, give examples of settings in which each is useful and discuss appropriate estimators including their assumptions. We illustrate the impact of the predictimand choice in a dataset of patients with end-stage kidney disease. We argue that clearly defining the estimand is equally important in prediction research as in causal inference.},

  abstract = {Recently, many researchers have advanced data-driven methods for modeling heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs). Even still, estimation of HTEs is a difficult task -- these methods frequently over- or under-estimate the treatment effects, leading to poor calibration of the resulting models. However, while many methods exist for evaluating the calibration of prediction and classification models, formal approaches to assess the calibration of HTE models are limited to the calibration slope. In this paper, we define an analogue of the \textbackslash smash\{(\$\textbackslash ell\_2\$)\} expected calibration error for HTEs, and propose a robust estimator. Our approach is motivated by doubly robust treatment effect estimators, making it unbiased, and resilient to confounding, overfitting, and high-dimensionality issues. Furthermore, our method is straightforward to adapt to many structures under which treatment effects can be identified, including randomized trials, observational studies, and survival analysis. We illustrate how to use our proposed metric to evaluate the calibration of learned HTE models through the application to the CRITEO-UPLIFT Trial.},
