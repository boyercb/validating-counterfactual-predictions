  abstract = {The problem of estimating causal effects of treatments from observational data falls beyond the realm of supervised learning \{—\} because counterfactual data is inaccessible, we can never observe the true causal effects. In the absence of "supervision", how can we evaluate the performance of causal inference methods? In this paper, we use influence functions \{—\} the functional derivatives of a loss function \{—\} to develop a model validation procedure that estimates the estimation error of causal inference methods. Our procedure utilizes a Taylor-like expansion to approximate the loss function of a method on a given dataset in terms of the influence functions of its loss on a "synthesized", proximal dataset with known causal effects. Under minimal regularity assumptions, we show that our procedure is consistent and efficient. Experiments on 77 benchmark datasets show that using our procedure, we can accurately predict the comparative performances of state-of-the-art causal inference methods applied to a given observational study.},

  abstract = {Prognostic models are used in medicine for investigating patient outcome in relation to patient and disease characteristics. Such models do not always work well in practice, so it is widely recommended that they need to be validated. The idea of validating a prognostic model is generally taken to mean establishing that it works satisfactorily for patients other than those from whose data it was derived. In this paper we examine what is meant by validation and review why it is necessary. We consider how to validate a model and suggest that it is desirable to consider two rather different aspects – statistical and clinical validity – and examine some general approaches to validation. We illustrate the issues using several case studies. Copyright © 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The cohort will be selected from six US field centers. Approximately 38\% of the cohort will be White, 28\% African-American, 23\% Hispanic, and 11\% Asian (of Chinese descent). Baseline measurements will include measurement of coronary calcium using computed tomography; measurement of ventricular mass and function using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging; measurement of flow-mediated brachial artery endothelial vasodilation, carotid intimal-medial wall thickness, and distensibility of the carotid arteries using ultrasonography; measurement of peripheral vascular disease using ankle and brachial blood pressures; electrocardiography; and assessments of microalbuminuria, standard CVD risk factors, sociodemographic factors, life habits, and psychosocial factors. Blood samples will be assayed for putative biochemical risk factors and stored for use in nested case-control studies. DNA will be extracted and lymphocytes will be immortalized for genetic studies. Measurement of selected subclinical disease indicators and risk factors will be repeated for the study of progression over 7 years. Participants will be followed through 2008 for identification and characterization of CVD events, including acute myocardial infarction and other coronary heart disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, and congestive heart failure; therapeutic interventions for CVD; and mortality.},

  abstract = {Algorithmic risk assessments are increasingly used to help humans make decisions in high-stakes settings, such as medicine, criminal justice and education. In each of these cases, the purpose of the risk assessment tool is to inform actions, such as medical treatments or release conditions, often with the aim of reducing the likelihood of an adverse event such as hospital readmission or recidivism. Problematically, most tools are trained and evaluated on historical data in which the outcomes observed depend on the historical decision-making policy. These tools thus reflect risk under the historical policy, rather than under the different decision options that the tool is intended to inform. Even when tools are constructed to predict risk under a specific decision, they are often improperly evaluated as predictors of the target outcome. Focusing on the evaluation task, in this paper we define counterfactual analogues of common predictive performance and algorithmic fairness metrics that we argue are better suited for the decision-making context. We introduce a new method for estimating the proposed metrics using doubly robust estimation. We provide theoretical results that show that only under strong conditions can fairness according to the standard metric and the counterfactual metric simultaneously hold. Consequently, fairness-promoting methods that target parity in a standard fairness metric may --- and as we show empirically, do --- induce greater imbalance in the counterfactual analogue. We provide empirical comparisons on both synthetic data and a real world child welfare dataset to demonstrate how the proposed method improves upon standard practice.},

Generally, to learn such counterfactual prediction models from observational data on historical decisions and corresponding outcomes, one must measure all factors that jointly affect the outcomes and the decision taken. Motivated by decision support applications, we study the counterfactual prediction task in the setting where all relevant factors are captured in the historical data, but it is either undesirable or impermissible to use some such factors in the prediction model. We refer to this setting as runtime confounding. We propose a doubly-robust procedure for learning counterfactual prediction models in this setting. Our theoretical analysis and experimental results suggest that our method often outperforms competing approaches. We also present a validation procedure for evaluating the performance of counterfactual prediction methods.},

  abstract = {Skepticism about the assumption of no unmeasured confounding, also known as exchangeability, is often warranted in making causal inferences from observational data; because exchangeability hinges on an investigator's ability to accurately measure covariates that capture all potential sources of confounding. In practice, the most one can hope for is that covariate measurements are at best proxies of the true underlying confounding mechanism operating in a given observational study. In this paper, we consider the framework of proximal causal inference introduced by Tchetgen Tchetgen et al. (2020), which while explicitly acknowledging covariate measurements as imperfect proxies of confounding mechanisms, offers an opportunity to learn about causal effects in settings where exchangeability on the basis of measured covariates fails. We make a number of contributions to proximal inference including (i) an alternative set of conditions for nonparametric proximal identification of the average treatment effect; (ii) general semiparametric theory for proximal estimation of the average treatment effect including efficiency bounds for key semiparametric models of interest; (iii) a characterization of proximal doubly robust and locally efficient estimators of the average treatment effect. Moreover, we provide analogous identification and efficiency results for the average treatment effect on the treated. Our approach is illustrated via simulation studies and a data application on evaluating the effectiveness of right heart catheterization in the intensive care unit of critically ill patients.},

  abstract = {Although often conflated, determining the best treatment for an individual (the task of a doctor) is fundamentally different from determining the average effect of treatment in a population (the purpose of a trial). In this paper, we review concepts of heterogeneity of treatment effects (HTE) essential in providing the evidence base for precision medicine and patient-centred care, and explore some inherent limitations of using group data (e.g. from a randomized trial) to guide treatment decisions for individuals. We distinguish between person-level HTE (i.e. that individuals experience different effects from a treatment) and group-level HTE (i.e. that subgroups have different average treatment effects), and discuss the reference class problem, engendered by the large number of potentially informative subgroupings of a study population (each of which may lead to applying a different estimated effect to the same patient), and the scale dependence of group-level HTE. We also review the limitations of conventional ‘one-variable-at-a-time’ subgroup analyses and discuss the potential benefits of using more comprehensive subgrouping schemes that incorporate information on multiple variables, such as those based on predicted outcome risk. Understanding the conceptual underpinnings of HTE is critical for understanding how studies can be designed, analysed, and interpreted to better inform individualized clinical decisions.},

To address this inherent limitation of prediction, we propose an approach to counterfactual prediction based on the g-formula to predict risk across populations that differ in their distribution of treatment strategies. We apply this to predict 5-year risk of mortality among persons receiving care for HIV in the U.S. Veterans Health Administration under different hypothetical treatment strategies. First, we implement a conventional approach to develop a prediction algorithm in the observed data and show how the algorithm may fail when transported to new populations with different treatment strategies. Second, we generate counterfactual data under different treatment strategies and use it to assess the robustness of the original algorithm’s performance to these differences and to develop counterfactual prediction algorithms. We discuss how estimating counterfactual risks under a particular treatment strategy is more challenging than conventional prediction as it requires the same data, methods, and unverifiable assumptions as causal inference. However, this may be required when the alternative assumption of constant treatment patterns across deployment settings is unlikely to hold and new data is not yet available to retrain the algorithm.},

  abstract = {To which groups of patients can the results of clinical trials be applied? This question is often inappropriately answered by reference to the trial entry criteria. Instead, the benefit and harm (adverse events, discomfort of treatment, etc) of treatment could be assessed separately for individual patients. Patients at greatest risk of a disease will have the greatest net benefit as benefit to patients usually increases with risk while harm remains comparatively fixed. To assess net benefit, the relative risks should come from (a meta-analysis of) randomised trials; the risk in individual patients should come from multivariate risk equations derived from cohort studies. However, before making firm conclusions, the assumptions of fixed adverse effects and constant reduction in relative risk need to be checked. Should all patients with acute myocardial infarct receive streptokinase? Should all patients with non-valvar atrial fibrillation receive warfarin? Such questions are best answered by assessing benefits and risks in each patient rather than focusing on the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the trial. For example, patients with a history of peptic ulcer were often excluded from thrombolytic trials because it would be unethical to put such patients at risk of major bleeding episodes, given the lack of proved benefit. However, now that we know the size of the benefit--about three deaths saved for every 100 patients treated1--clinicians must make an informed decision that weighs this benefit against the potential for harm in patients with ulcers. Relying on the eligibility criteria for clinical trials is both erroneous and limiting. A too restrictive generalisation needs to be guarded against, and we are advised to ask, “Are the patients in this study so different from my patients that I could not apply the study results?”2 This is good advice, but how then do we decide when a …},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To compare different methods to handle treatment when developing a prognostic model that aims to produce accurate probabilities of the outcome of individuals if left untreated. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Simulations were performed based on two normally distributed predictors, a binary outcome, and a binary treatment, mimicking a randomized trial or an observational study. Comparison was made between simply ignoring treatment (SIT), restricting the analytical data set to untreated individuals (AUT), inverse probability weighting (IPW), and explicit modeling of treatment (MT). Methods were compared in terms of predictive performance of the model and the proportion of incorrect treatment decisions. RESULTS: Omitting a genuine predictor of the outcome from the prognostic model decreased model performance, in both an observational study and a randomized trial. In randomized trials, the proportion of incorrect treatment decisions was smaller when applying AUT or MT, compared to SIT and IPW. In observational studies, MT was superior to all other methods regarding the proportion of incorrect treatment decisions. CONCLUSION: If a prognostic model aims to produce correct probabilities of the outcome in the absence of treatment, ignoring treatments that affect that outcome can lead to suboptimal model performance and incorrect treatment decisions. Explicitly, modeling treatment is recommended.},

These models can use a mixture of categorical and continuous variables and can handle partially observed (censored) responses. However, uncritical application of modelling techniques can result in models that poorly fit the dataset at hand, or, even more likely, inaccurately predict outcomes on new subjects. One must know how to measure qualities of a model's fit in order to avoid poorly fitted or overfitted models. Measurement of predictive accuracy can be difficult for survival time data in the presence of censoring. We discuss an easily interpretable index of predictive discrimination as well as methods for assessing calibration of predicted survival probabilities. Both types of predictive accuracy should be unbiasedly validated using bootstrapping or cross-validation, before using predictions in a new data series. We discuss some of the hazards of poorly fitted and overfitted regression models and present one modelling strategy that avoids many of the problems discussed. The methods described are applicable to all regression models, but are particularly needed for binary, ordinal, and time-to-event outcomes. Methods are illustrated with a survival analysis in prostate cancer using Cox regression.},

In case of a binary outcome, these predictions of absolute individualized treatment effect require knowledge of the individual's risk without treatment and incorporation of a possibly differential treatment effect (ie, varying with patient characteristics). In this article, we lay out the causal structure of individualized treatment effect in terms of potential outcomes and describe the required assumptions that underlie a causal interpretation of its prediction. Subsequently, we describe regression models and model estimation techniques that can be used to move from average to more individualized treatment effect predictions. We focus mainly on logistic regression-based methods that are both well-known and naturally provide the required probabilistic estimates. We incorporate key components from both causal inference and prediction research to arrive at individualized treatment effect predictions. While the separate components are well known, their successful amalgamation is very much an ongoing field of research. We cut the problem down to its essentials in the setting of a randomized trial, discuss the importance of a clear definition of the estimand of interest, provide insight into the required assumptions, and give guidance with respect to modeling and estimation options. Simulated data illustrate the potential of different modeling options across scenarios that vary both average treatment effect and treatment effect heterogeneity. Two applied examples illustrate individualized treatment effect prediction in randomized trial data.},

  abstract = {The use of evidence from clinical trials to support decisions for individual patients is a form of “reference class forecasting”: implicit predictions for an individual are made on the basis of outcomes in a reference class of “similar” patients treated with alternative therapies. Evidence based medicine has generally emphasized the broad reference class of patients qualifying for a trial. Yet patients in a trial (and in clinical practice) differ from one another in many ways that can affect the outcome of interest and the potential for benefit. The central goal of personalized medicine, in its various forms, is to narrow the reference class to yield more patient specific effect estimates to support more individualized clinical decision making. This article will review fundamental conceptual problems with the prediction of outcome risk and heterogeneity of treatment effect (HTE), as well as the limitations of conventional (one-variable-at-a-time) subgroup analysis. It will also discuss several regression based approaches to “predictive” heterogeneity of treatment effect analysis, including analyses based on “risk modeling” (such as stratifying trial populations by their risk of the primary outcome or their risk of serious treatment-related harms) and analysis based on “effect modeling” (which incorporates modifiers of relative effect). It will illustrate these approaches with clinical examples and discuss their respective strengths and vulnerabilities.},

Here, we provide identification results for the AUC in the target population when outcome and covariate data are available from the sample of the source population, but only covariate data are available from the sample of the target population. In this setting, we propose three estimators for the AUC in the target population and show that they are consistent and asymptotically normal. We evaluate the finite-sample performance of the estimators using simulations and use them to estimate the AUC in a nationally representative target population from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey for a lung cancer risk prediction model developed using source population data from the National Lung Screening Trial.},

Unfortunately, trial populations are rarely representative of the target populations of public health or clinical interest. Unless the relevant differences between trial and target populations are accounted for, subgroup results from trials might not reflect which groups in the target population will benefit most from the intervention. Transportability provides a rigorous framework for applying results derived in potentially highly selected study populations to external target populations. The method requires that researchers measure and adjust for all variables that 1) modify the effect of interest and 2) differ between the target and trial populations. To date, applications of transportability have focused on the external validity of overall study results and understanding within-trial heterogeneity; however, this approach has not yet been used for subgroup analyses of trials. Through an example from the Iniciativa Profilaxis Pre-Exposición (iPrEx) study (multiple countries, 2007–2010) of preexposure prophylaxis for human immunodeficiency virus, we illustrate how transporting subgroup analyses can produce target-specific subgroup effect estimates and numbers needed to treat. This approach could lead to more tailored and accurate guidance for resource allocation and cost-effectiveness analyses.},

Yet, decision-makers are often interested in examining treatment effects in subgroups of the target population defined in terms of only a few discrete covariates. Here, we propose methods for estimating subgroup-specific potential outcome means and average treatment effects in generalizability and transportability analyses, using outcome model-based (g-formula), weighting, and augmented weighting estimators. We consider estimating subgroup-specific average treatment effects in the target population and its non-randomized subset, and provide methods that are appropriate both for nested and non-nested trial designs. As an illustration, we apply the methods to data from the Coronary Artery Surgery Study to compare the effect of surgery plus medical therapy versus medical therapy alone for chronic coronary artery disease in subgroups defined by history of myocardial infarction.},

  abstract = {Most work on extending (generalizing or transporting) inferences from a randomized trial to a target population has focused on estimating average treatment effects (i.e., averaged over the target population’s covariate distribution). Yet, in the presence of strong effect modification by baseline covariates, the average treatment effect in the target population may be less relevant for guiding treatment decisions. Instead, the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) as a function of key effect modifiers may be a more useful estimand. Recent work on estimating target population CATEs using baseline covariate, treatment, and outcome data from the trial and covariate data from the target population only allows for the examination of heterogeneity over distinct subgroups. We describe flexible pseudo-outcome regression modeling methods for estimating target population CATEs conditional on discrete or continuous baseline covariates when the trial is embedded in a sample from the target population (i.e., in nested trial designs). We construct pointwise confidence intervals for the CATE at a specific value of the effect modifiers and uniform confidence bands for the CATE function. Last, we illustrate the methods using data from the Coronary Artery Surgery Study (CASS) to estimate CATEs given history of myocardial infarction and baseline ejection fraction value in the target population of all trial-eligible patients with stable ischemic heart disease.},

  abstract = {In order to estimate the causal effects of one or more exposures or treatments on an outcome of interest, one has to account for the effect of "confounding factors" which both covary with the exposures or treatments and are independent predictors of the outcome. In this paper we present regression methods which, in contrast to standard methods, adjust for the confounding effect of multiple continuous or discrete covariates by modelling the conditional expectation of the exposures or treatments given the confounders. In the special case of a univariate dichotomous exposure or treatment, this conditional expectation is identical to what Rosenbaum and Rubin have called the propensity score. They have also proposed methods to estimate causal effects by modelling the propensity score. Our methods generalize those of Rosenbaum and Rubin in several ways. First, our approach straightforwardly allows for multivariate exposures or treatments, each of which may be continuous, ordinal, or discrete. Second, even in the case of a single dichotomous exposure, our approach does not require subclassification or matching on the propensity score so that the potential for "residual confounding," i.e., bias, due to incomplete matching is avoided. Third, our approach allows a rather general formalization of the idea that it is better to use the "estimated propensity score" than the true propensity score even when the true score is known. The additional power of our approach derives from the fact that we assume the causal effects of the exposures or treatments can be described by the parametric component of a semiparametric regression model. To illustrate our methods, we reanalyze the effect of current cigarette smoking on the level of forced expiratory volume in one second in a cohort of 2,713 adult white males. We compare the results with those obtained using standard methods.},

  abstract = {In applied problems it is common to specify a model for the conditional mean of a response given a set of regressors. A subset of the regressors may be missing for some study subjects either by design or happenstance. In this article we propose a new class of semiparametric estimators, based on inverse probability weighted estimating equations, that are consistent for parameter vector α\textsubscript{0} of the conditional mean model when the data are missing at random in the sense of Rubin and the missingness probabilities are either known or can be parametrically modeled. We show that the asymptotic variance of the optimal estimator in our class attains the semiparametric variance bound for the model by first showing that our estimation problem is a special case of the general problem of parameter estimation in an arbitrary semiparametric model in which the data are missing at random and the probability of observing complete data is bounded away from 0, and then deriving a representation for the efficient score, the semiparametric variance bound, and the influence function of any regular, asymptotically linear estimator in this more general estimation problem. Because the optimal estimator depends on the unknown probability law generating the data, we propose locally and globally adaptive semiparametric efficient estimators. We compare estimators in our class with previously proposed estimators. We show that each previous estimator is asymptotically equivalent to some, usually inefficient, estimator in our class. This equivalence is a consequence of a proposition stating that every regular asymptotic linear estimator of α\textsubscript{0} is asymptotically equivalent to some estimator in our class. We compare various estimators in a small simulation study and offer some practical recommendations.},

If, conditional on the history of the observed data up to t, the hazard of dropping out of the study (i.e., censoring) at time t does not depend on the possibly unobserved data subsequent to t, we say drop-out is ignorable or explainable (Rubin, 1976). On the other hand, if the hazard of drop-out depends on the possibly unobserved future, we say drop-out is non-ignorable or, equivalently, that there is selection bias on unobservables. Neither the existence of selection bias on unobservables nor its magnitude is identifiable from the joint distribution of the observables. In view of this fact, we argue that the data analyst should conduct a “sensitivity analysis” to quantify how one’s inference concerning an outcome of interest varies as a function of the magnitude of non-identifiable selection bias.},

For instance, if I choose not to treat this patient, are they likely to die? Practitioners commonly use supervised learning algorithms to fit predictive models that help decision-makers reason about likely future outcomes, but we show that this approach is unreliable, and sometimes even dangerous. The key issue is that supervised learning algorithms are highly sensitive to the policy used to choose actions in the training data, which causes the model to capture relationships that do not generalize. We propose using a different learning objective that predicts counterfactuals instead of predicting outcomes under an existing action policy as in supervised learning. To support decision-making in temporal settings, we introduce the Counterfactual Gaussian Process (CGP) to predict the counterfactual future progression of continuous-time trajectories under sequences of future actions. We demonstrate the benefits of the CGP on two important decision-support tasks: risk prediction and “what if?” reasoning for individualized treatment planning.},

A given treatment (e.g. a drug or advertisement) should be administered only to those who will respond most positively, and certainly not to those who will be harmed by it. Individual-level treatment effects can be estimated with tools adapted from machine learning, but different models can yield contradictory estimates. Unlike risk prediction models, however, treatment effect models cannot be easily evaluated against each other using a held-out test set because the true treatment effect itself is never directly observed. Besides outcome prediction accuracy, several metrics that can leverage held-out data to evaluate treatment effects models have been proposed, but they are not widely used. We provide a didactic framework that elucidates the relationships between the different approaches and compare them all using a variety of simulations of both randomized and observational data. Our results show that researchers estimating heterogenous treatment effects need not limit themselves to a single model-fitting algorithm. Instead of relying on a single method, multiple models fit by a diverse set of algorithms should be evaluated against each other using an objective function learned from the validation set. The model minimizing that objective should be used for estimating the individual treatment effect for future individuals.},

However, researchers may be concerned that in fact subgroup-specific effects differ between sample and population. In this brief report, we explore the generalizability of subgroup effects. First, we derive the bias in the sample average treatment effect estimator as an estimate of the population average treatment effect when subgroup effects in the sample do not directly generalize. Next, we present a Monte Carlo simulation to explore bias due to unmeasured heterogeneity of subgroup effects across sample and population. Finally, we examine the potential for bias in an illustrative data example. Understanding the generalizability of subgroup effects may lead to increased use of these methods for making externally valid inferences of treatment effects using a study sample.},

  abstract = {Clinical prediction models (CPMs) can inform decision making about treatment initiation, which requires predicted risks assuming no treatment is given. However, this is challenging since CPMs are usually derived using data sets where patients received treatment, often initiated postbaseline as “treatment drop-ins.” This study proposes the use of marginal structural models (MSMs) to adjust for treatment drop-in. We illustrate the use of MSMs in the CPM framework through simulation studies that represent randomized controlled trials and real-world observational data and the example of statin initiation for cardiovascular disease prevention. The simulations include a binary treatment and a covariate, each recorded at two timepoints and having a prognostic effect on a binary outcome. The bias in predicted risk was examined in a model ignoring treatment, a model fitted on treatment-naïve patients (at baseline), a model including baseline treatment, and the MSM. In all simulation scenarios, all models except the MSM underestimated the risk of outcome given absence of treatment. These results were supported in the statin initiation example, which showed that ignoring statin initiation postbaseline resulted in models that significantly underestimated the risk of a cardiovascular disease event occurring within 10 years. Consequently, CPMs that do not acknowledge treatment drop-in can lead to underallocation of treatment. In conclusion, when developing CPMs to predict treatment-naïve risk, researchers should consider using MSMs to adjust for treatment drop-in, and also seek to exploit the ability of MSMs to allow estimation of individual treatment effects.},

  abstract = {Prediction models are often built and evaluated using data from a population that differs from the target population where model-derived predictions are intended to be used in. In this article, we present methods for evaluating model performance in the target population when some observations are right censored. The methods assume that outcome and covariate data are available from a source population used for model development and covariates, but no outcome data, are available from the target population. We evaluate the finite sample performance of the proposed estimators using simulations and apply the methods to transport a prediction model built using data from a lung cancer screening trial to a nationally representative population of participants eligible for lung cancer screening.},

  abstract = {We consider the estimation of measures of model performance in a target population when covariate and outcome data are available on a sample from some source population and covariate data, but not outcome data, are available on a simple random sample from the target population. When outcome data are not available from the target population, identification of measures of model performance is possible under an untestable assumption that the outcome and population (source or target population) are independent conditional on covariates. In practice, this assumption is uncertain and, in some cases, controversial. Therefore, sensitivity analysis may be useful for examining the impact of assumption violations on inferences about model performance. Here, we propose an exponential tilt sensitivity analysis model and develop statistical methods to determine how sensitive measures of model performance are to violations of the assumption of conditional independence between outcome and population. We provide identification results and estimators for the risk in the target population, examine the large-sample properties of the estimators, and apply the estimators to data on individuals with stable ischemic heart disease.},

  abstract = {The performance of prediction models can be assessed using a variety of methods and metrics. Traditional measures for binary and survival outcomes include the Brier score to indicate overall model performance, the concordance (or c) statistic for discriminative ability (or area under the receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve), and goodness-of-fit statistics for calibration. Several new measures have recently been proposed that can be seen as refinements of discrimination measures, including variants of the c statistic for survival, reclassification tables, net reclassification improvement (NRI), and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI). Moreover, decision—analytic measures have been proposed, including decision curves to plot the net benefit achieved by making decisions based on model predictions. We aimed to define the role of these relatively novel approaches in the evaluation of the performance of prediction models. For illustration, we present a case study of predicting the presence of residual tumor versus benign tissue in patients with testicular cancer (n = 544 for model development, n = 273 for external validation). We suggest that reporting discrimination and calibration will always be important for a prediction model. Decision-analytic measures should be reported if the predictive model is to be used for clinical decisions. Other measures of performance may be warranted in specific applications, such as reclassification metrics to gain insight into the value of adding a novel predictor to an established model.},

  abstract = {The deployment of machine learning (ML) and statistical models is beginning to transform the practice of healthcare, with models now able to help clinicians diagnose conditions like pneumonia and skin cancer, and to predict which hospital patients are at risk of adverse events such as septic shock. A major concern, however, is that model performance is heavily tied to details particular to the dataset the model was developed on—even slight deviations from the training conditions can result in wildly different performance. For example, when researchers trained a model to diagnose pneumonia from chest X-rays using data from one health system, but evaluated on data from an external health system, they found the model performed significantly worse than it did internally (Zech and others, 2018). The model failed to generalize (i.e., predict accurately) due to the shifts between the training conditions (health system one) and the deployment/testing conditions (health system two). These shifts are very common when moving a model from the training phase to deployment and can take a variety of forms, including changes in patient demographics, disease prevalence, measurement timing, equipment, treatment patterns, and more. Beyond contributing to poor performance, failing to account for shifts can also lead to dangerous decisions in practice: the system can fail to diagnose severely ill patients or recommend harmful treatments. This problem of shifting conditions which prevent generalization is referred to as dataset shift (Quiñonero-Candela and others, 2009), and in this article, we explain what it is, why it occurs, give an overview of the types of existing solutions, and discuss open challenges that remain.},

  abstract = {A standard assumption for causal inference from observational data is that one has measured a sufficiently rich set of covariates to ensure that within covariate strata, subjects are exchangeable across observed treatment values. Skepticism about the exchangeability assumption in observational studies is often warranted because it hinges on investigators' ability to accurately measure covariates capturing all potential sources of confounding. Realistically, confounding mechanisms can rarely if ever, be learned with certainty from measured covariates. One can therefore only ever hope that covariate measurements are at best proxies of true underlying confounding mechanisms operating in an observational study, thus invalidating causal claims made on basis of standard exchangeability conditions. Causal learning from proxies is a challenging inverse problem which has to date remained unresolved. In this paper, we introduce a formal potential outcome framework for proximal causal learning, which while explicitly acknowledging covariate measurements as imperfect proxies of confounding mechanisms, offers an opportunity to learn about causal effects in settings where exchangeability on the basis of measured covariates fails. Sufficient conditions for nonparametric identification are given, leading to the proximal g-formula and corresponding proximal g-computation algorithm for estimation. These may be viewed as generalizations of Robins' foundational g-formula and g-computation algorithm, which account explicitly for bias due to unmeasured confounding. Both point treatment and time-varying treatment settings are considered, and an application of proximal g-computation of causal effects is given for illustration.},

Analogous to the estimand framework recently proposed by the European Medicines Agency for clinical trials, we propose a ‘predictimand’ framework of different questions that may be of interest when predicting risk in relation to treatment started after baseline. We provide a formal definition of the estimands matching these questions, give examples of settings in which each is useful and discuss appropriate estimators including their assumptions. We illustrate the impact of the predictimand choice in a dataset of patients with end-stage kidney disease. We argue that clearly defining the estimand is equally important in prediction research as in causal inference.},

  abstract = {Recently, many researchers have advanced data-driven methods for modeling heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs). Even still, estimation of HTEs is a difficult task -- these methods frequently over- or under-estimate the treatment effects, leading to poor calibration of the resulting models. However, while many methods exist for evaluating the calibration of prediction and classification models, formal approaches to assess the calibration of HTE models are limited to the calibration slope. In this paper, we define an analogue of the \textbackslash smash\{(\$\textbackslash ell\_2\$)\} expected calibration error for HTEs, and propose a robust estimator. Our approach is motivated by doubly robust treatment effect estimators, making it unbiased, and resilient to confounding, overfitting, and high-dimensionality issues. Furthermore, our method is straightforward to adapt to many structures under which treatment effects can be identified, including randomized trials, observational studies, and survival analysis. We illustrate how to use our proposed metric to evaluate the calibration of learned HTE models through the application to the CRITEO-UPLIFT Trial.},
