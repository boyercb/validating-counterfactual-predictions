\section{Introduction} \label{sec:introduction}

Many common tasks in prediction modeling can be viewed as a form of counterfactual prediction. First, prediction models are often deployed in settings that differ from those in which they are trained and one of the ways settings may differ is in terms of treatment patterns after baseline \cite{van_geloven_prediction_2020}. For example, a model fit in a setting where 5\% are treated over the follow up period may not produce valid predictions in a setting where 50\% are treated and vice versa. Even when models are deployed in the same setting, treatment policies may change over time, affecting who is likely to be treated and leading to problems of ``domain adaption'' or ``dataset shift'' \cite{finlayson_clinician_2021, subbaswamy_development_2020}. These differences between training and deployment settings can cause the performance of models to degrade, particularly when, as is often the case, model predictors are themselves correlated with, or direct determinants of, treatment \cite{pajouheshnia_accounting_2017,groenwold_explicit_2016-1}. 

When faced with a change in treatment policy, ideally, one would re-train the model using data reflecting the current patterns of treatment in the target population where the model will be applied. Collecting the necessary data to re-train the model, however, may be inordinately expensive or time consuming. Absent sufficient resources or as a stop gap, one might consider using existing training data to tailor the model to target the expected outcome that would be observed were treatment to be administered as in the deployment setting \cite{dickerman_predicting_2022}. Alternatively, one might want to estimate how poorly the existing model is likely to perform in the deployment setting, to determine whether additional data collection efforts are worthwhile. In either case, the research questions pertain to counterfactual predictions.

Second, there are instances in which the prediction question itself is inherently counterfactual. For instance, clinicians may use a model to counsel patients about their risk of disease if they were to remain untreated or to compare risks under alternative treatment strategies \cite{lin_scoping_2021,schulam_reliable_2017-1}. In some circumstances, such as when data from a randomized trial are used to model conditional average treatment effects, this can be done without additional formalism \cite{hoogland_tutorial_2021,kent_personalized_2018,kent_predictive_2020,glasziou_evidence_1995,dahabreh_using_2016}. In contrast, when training data are obtained from an observational study where treatment initiation over follow up is not strictly controlled by the investigators, the predictions most relevant to decision-making are counterfactual \cite{dickerman_counterfactual_2020,schulam_reliable_2017-1}. 

In both instances, when treatment policies change across settings or when the prediction question is inherently counterfactual, we need methods for tailoring models to answer counterfactual prediction questions, when data on the full set of potential outcomes is not available. We also need performance measures that evaluate model performance in these new environments without assuming the prediction model is correctly specified. Here, we examine the conditions under which tailoring a model for counterfactual prediction is possible using training data alone. Under similar conditions, we also show that the counterfactual performance of the model may be estimated independently from the method used to fit the model and may be evaluated even if the model is misspecified. Performance measures can therefore be used to differentiate between better and worse-performing models or to quantify how badly a model is likely to perform in a new setting. 


\section{Set up and notation} \label{sec:setup}
Let $Y$ be the outcome of interest, $X$ a vector of baseline covariates, and $A$ an indicator of treatment over the follow up period. We assume that data are obtained from a simple random sample from a target population $\{(X_i, A_i, Y_i)\}_{i=1}^n$ in which treatment is initiated according to pattern $f^{obs}(A | X)$. Covariates in $X$ include a set sufficient to control confounding of the treatment-outcome relationship ($L$) as well as additional predictors of the outcome ($P$). Our goal is to build a prediction model for $Y$ using only covariates $X^*$ which are a subset of $X$, chosen based on their availability and predictive potential rather than on whether they can help control confounding (note that $X^*$ can include components of both $L$ and $P$). An example causal directed acyclic graph for this process is shown in Figure \ref{fig:dag1}. 

\begin{figure}[t]

    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Example causal directed acyclic graph for prediction in a setting with a single time fixed treatment $A$ over follow up.}
    \label{fig:dag1}
\end{figure}

The data are randomly split into a training set of $n_{train}$ observations and a test set of $n_{test}$ observations, with $n = n_{train} + n_{test}$. Let $D_{train}$ and $D_{test}$ be indicators of whether an observation is in the training set or test set respectively. As is customary, we use the training set to build a prediction model for the expected outcome conditional on covariates $\E[Y | X^*]$ and, then use the test set to evaluate model performance. Our results, however, apply equally to existing prediction models or (directly measured) biomarkers, in which case splitting is not necessary. Let $\mu_{\beta}(X^*)$ be a parametric model, indexed by parameter $\beta$, and $\mu_{\widehat{\beta}}(X^*)$ be the ``fitted'' model using parameter estimates $\widehat{\beta}$. We allow for the possibility that model $\mu_{\beta}(X^*)$ is \textit{misspecified}. For a particular estimand such as $\E[Y | X^*]$, a model is correctly specified if there exists $\beta_0 \in \mathcal{B}$, where $\mathcal{B}$ is the parameter space of $\beta$, such that $\mu_{\beta_0}(X^*) = \E[Y | X^*]$ and the model is misspecified if no such $\beta_0$ exists. We use $f(\cdot)$ generically to denote densities.

To define counterfactual estimands of interest, let $Y^a$ be the potential outcome under an intervention which sets treatment $A$ to $a$. To keep our notation simple, here we focus on the case that treatment is time-fixed -- it is initiated after baseline and sustained throughout or its effect is independent of duration. In Section \ref{sec:timevarying} of the Appendix, we extend our setup to handle time-varying treatments.  We also assume interventions on $A$ are \textit{deterministic}, but extend to \textit{random} and \textit{dynamic} interventions in Section \ref{sec:randomdynamic} of the Appendix. These may be more relevant for some real world prediction tasks, for instance, when evaluating the performance of models in settings where treatment differences are stochastic. Finally, we also assume that there is no loss to follow up, but note that our results can be extended by recognizing censoring can be accommodated using the methods we proposed for time-varying treatment \cite{hernan_causal_2020} for a hypothetical intervention to prevent loss-to-followup.  

\section{Estimands for assessing model performance} \label{sec:targets}
Our goal is to train a model for counterfactual prediction and determine the model's performance. We posit a parametric prediction model $\mu_{\beta}(X^*)$ for the expected potential outcome under intervention $A = a$ conditional on covariates $\E[Y^a | X^*]$, which we wish to estimate from the training dataset. The model may be misspecified, such as if, for instance, it is a model trained on another target such as the expected (factual) outcome in the source population $\E[Y | X^*]$.

To evaluate prediction model performance, a number of measures have been proposed in the prediction literature \cite{harrell_multivariable_1996, altman_what_2000, steyerberg_clinical_2019}. These measures generally compare fitted predictions $\mu_{\widehat{\beta}}(X^*)$ and the observed outcomes $Y$ via a distance function and associated sample statistic. For counterfactual predictions, however, model evaluation is more challenging because the potential outcome $Y^a$ is not directly observed. Yet, as we will show, under certain conditions the expected value of the performance measure may still be identified from the observed data in the test set. An example performance measure of interest is 
\begin{equation*}
    \psi(a) = \E[(Y^a - \mu_{\widehat{\beta}}(X^*))^2 \mid D_{test} = 1]
\end{equation*}
where the squared error loss $(Y^a - \mu_{\widehat{\beta}}(X^*))^2$ quantifies the discrepancy between the potential outcome under treatment level $A = a$ and the model prediction $\mu_{\widehat{\beta}}(X^*)$ in terms of the squared difference. In the main text, we focus on the mean squared error as the performance measure of interest $\psi(a)$. In the Appendix, we extend our results to the case where the measure is any member of a generic class of counterfactual loss functions $L(Y^a,  \mu_{\widehat{\beta}}(X^*))$ (Section \ref{sec:tf_proof}) as well as more complex risk-based measures such as area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC, Section \ref{sec:auc}), which depends on paired observations, and the calibration curve (Section \ref{sec:calib}), which is a functional. Importantly, all the measures considered are identifiable without assuming that the model $\mu_{\widehat{\beta}}(X^*)$ is correctly specified.

\section{Identifiability conditions} \label{sec:identifiability}
We will assume the following identifiability assumptions which have been described in more detail elsewhere \cite{hernan_causal_2020, robins_new_1986, robins_graphical_1987}.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[A1.] \textit{Consistency.} If $A = a$, then $Y^a = Y$ 
    \item[A2.] \textit{Conditional exchangeability.} $Y^a \perp\!\!\!\perp A \mid X$ 
    \item[A3.] \textit{Positivity.} For all $x$ with positive density, i.e. $f_X(x) > 0$, $\Pr[A = a \mid X = x] > 0$ 
\end{enumerate}

Consistency implies that observed outcomes among those with $A = a$ reflect potential outcomes under corresponding level of treatment. It would be violated if, for instance, there were multiple ``hidden'' versions of the treatment under consideration \cite{rubin_randomization_1980}. The exchangeability condition stipulates that treatment is conditionally independent of the potential outcome given covariates $X$. Finally, the positivity condition implies that there is a positive probability of observed treatment level $A = a$ in all strata of $X$.  

\section{Tailoring a model for counterfactual predictions} \label{sec:model}

As we show in Appendix Section \ref{sec:model_proof}, under the conditions above $\E[Y^a | X^*]$ is identified by
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:estimand1}
    \phi_a(X^*) \equiv \E[\E[Y \mid X, A = a, D_{train} = 1] \mid X^*, D_{train} = 1]
\end{equation}
or, equivalently, using an inverse probability weighted expression 
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:estimand2}
    \phi_a(X^*) = \E\left[\frac{I(A = a)}{\Pr[A = a \mid X, D_{train} = 1]} Y \Big| X^*, D_{train} = 1\right]
\end{equation}
The two expressions for $\phi_a(X^*)$ suggest possible approaches for tailoring the model for counterfactual predictions using only the training data. 

One approach, based on equation \ref{eqn:estimand1}, is to subset to participants with corresponding treatment level $A = a$ in the training data and fit a model $\mu_\beta(X)$ for the observed $Y$ conditional $X$, i.e. $\E[Y | X, A = a] = \mu_\beta(X)$. Then when the desired predictors $X^*$ are a subset of $X$, the covariates sufficient to ensure exchangeability,  predictions are marginalized (standardized) over the covariates in $X$ that are not in $X^*$. When the dimension of $X^*$ is small, this can be done nonparametrically; however, when $X^*$ is higher-dimensional, an additional modeling step will be required either (1) modeling the estimated $\widehat{\mu}_{\widehat{\beta}}(X)$ as a function of $X^*$, i.e. $\E[\widehat{\mu}_{\widehat{\beta}}(X) | X^*]$ or (2) modeling the conditional density of $X$ given $X^*$, i.e. $f(X | X^*)$.  The resulting predictions will be consistent for $\E[Y^a | X^*]$ provided all models are correctly specified. An alternative suggested in \cite{dickerman_predicting_2022}, would be to simulate samples from the model $\mu_\beta(X)$ and fit a second stage model $\mu^*_\beta(X^*)$ using only the subset of the predictors of interest. This is similar to the first standardization method above and has the advantage that the second stage model may be developed using an outcome with same support as the original $Y$.

A second approach, based on \ref{eqn:estimand2}, is to fit a weighted model $\mu_\beta(X^*)$, using for instance weighted maximum likelihood, with weights equal to the probability of receiving treatment level $A = a$ conditional on covariates $X$ necessary to ensure exchangeability, i.e., sample analogs of $W(a) = \frac{I(A = a)}{\Pr[A = a \mid X, D_{train} = 1]}$. This is the basis for previously proposed methods for counterfactual prediction based on inverse probability of treatment weighting \cite{sperrin_using_2018, van_geloven_prediction_2020}. Note that, as before, it is possible to specify a subset of predictors $X^*$ used in the prediction model $\mu_\beta(X^*)$ as compared to the full set of covariates $X$ required for exchangeability which are only necessary for defining the weights $W$, however a second marginalization or simulation step is not required. This means tailoring the model for counterfactual predictions using the weighting approach can be accomplished more easily using off-the-shelf software.

\section{Assessing model performance} \label{sec:performance}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Using the same identifiability conditions, in Appendix Section \ref{sec:tf_proof}, we show the model performance measure $\psi(a)$ is identifiable using data from the test set through the expression
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:mse1}
    \psi(a) \equiv \E\left[\E[(Y - \mu_{\widehat{\beta}}(X^*))^2 \mid X, A=a, D_{test} = 1] \mid D_{test} = 1\right]
\end{equation}
or, equivalently, using an inverse probability weighted expression, 
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:mse2}
    \psi(a) = \E\left[\frac{I(A = a)}{\Pr[A = a \mid X, D_{test} = 1]}(Y - \mu_{\widehat{\beta}}(X^*))^2 \mid D_{test} = 1\right]
\end{equation}
regardless of whether the model $\mu_{\widehat{\beta}}(X^*)$ has been tailored to target $\E[Y^a \mid X]$ or is correctly specified in general. 

As before, the two expression suggest two different approaches for the estimation of model performance using the test data alone. 

First, using the sample analog of expression (\ref{eqn:mse1}), an estimator of the target MSE is 
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:cl_estimator}
    \widehat{\psi}_{CL}(a) = \frac{1}{n_{test}} \sum_{i=1}^nI(D_{test, i} = 1)\widehat{h}_a(X_i)
\end{equation}
where $\widehat{h}_a(X)$ is an estimator for the conditional loss $\E[(Y - \mu_{\widehat{\beta}}(X^*))^2 \mid X, A=a, D_{test} = 1]$ and from the perspective of estimating $\psi(a)$ may be considered a nuisance function. To keep notation simple, we suppress the dependency of $\widehat{h}_a(X)$ on $\mu_{\widehat{\beta}}$. When the dimension of $X$ is small it may be possible to use sample analogs of $\widehat{h}_a(X)$. In almost all practical cases though some form of modeling will be required; in these cases, $\widehat{\psi}_{CL}(a)$ is a consistent estimator for $\psi(a)$ as long as the model for $\widehat{h}_a(X)$ is correctly specified.

Next, using the sample analog of expression (\ref{eqn:mse2}), an alternative weight-based estimator of the target MSE is 
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:ipw_estimator}
    \widehat{\psi}_{IPW}(a) = \frac{1}{n_{test}} \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{I(A_i = a, D_{test, i} = 1)}{\widehat{e}_a(X_i)}(Y_i - \mu_{\widehat{\beta}}(X^*_i))^2
\end{equation}
where $\widehat{e}_a(X)$ is another nuisance function estimating the probability of receiving treatment level $A = a$ conditional on $X$, i.e. $\Pr[A = a \mid X, D_{test} = 1]$. Again, when the dimension of $X$ is small it may be possible to use the sample analog of $\widehat{e}_a(X)$, but in most cases, it will have to be modeled. In these cases, $\widehat{\psi}_{IPW}(a)$ is a consistent estimator of $\psi(a)$ as long as the model for $\widehat{e}_a(X)$ is correctly specified.

The conditional loss estimator (\ref{eqn:cl_estimator}) relies on correctly specifying the model for the conditional loss and the weighting estimator (\ref{eqn:ipw_estimator})  relies on correctly specifying the model for the probability of treatment. In some settings, one estimator may be preferred over the other: when more is known about the mechanism for ``assigning'' treatment or when the outcome is very rare, the weighting estimator may be preferred \cite{robins_estimating_1992,braitman_rare_2002}; when the process that gives rise to the outcomes is well understood the conditional loss estimator may be preferred. In practice, however, both models may be difficult to specify correctly. Using data-adaptive and more flexible machine learning estimators for estimation of these nuisance models offers the possibility of capturing more complex data generation processes. These data-adaptive estimators generally have slower rates of convergence than the $\sqrt{n}$ rates of parametric models and therefore will not yield asymptotically valid confidence intervals \cite{chernozhukov_doubledebiased_2018}. To address this challenge, we can use a doubly-robust estimator which combines models for the conditional loss $\widehat{h}_a(X)$ and the probability of treatment $\widehat{e}_a(X)$, such as
\begin{equation}
    \widehat{\psi}_{DR}(a) = \frac{1}{n_{test}} \sum_{i=1}^n I(D_{test,i} = 1) \left[ \widehat{h}_a(X_i) + \frac{I(A_i = a)}{\widehat{e}_a(X_i)} \left\{ (Y_i - \mu_{\widehat{\beta}}(X^*_i))^2 - \widehat{h}_a(X_i)\right\}\right]
\end{equation}
As we show in Appendix section \ref{sec:dr}, under mild regularity conditions \cite{robins_higher_2008}, this estimator will be consistent if one of $\widehat{h}_a(X)$ and $\widehat{e}_a(X)$ is correctly specified. It also permits the use of machine learning or data-adaptive estimators that converge at rate slower than $\sqrt{n}$, thus allowing for more flexible estimation of the nuisance functions. This is due to the fact that the empirical process terms governing the convergence of $\widehat{\psi}_{DR}$ involve a product of the estimation errors for $\widehat{h}_a(X)$ and $\widehat{e}_a(X)$ which converge under the weaker condition that only the \textit{combined} rate of convergence for both nuisance functions is at least $\sqrt{n}$ \cite{chernozhukov_doubledebiased_2018}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Model and tuning parameter selection} \label{sec:selection}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Up to this point, we have assumed that $\mu_{\beta}(X^*)$ is a pre-specified parametric model and ignored any form of model selection (e.g. variable or other specification search) or data-adaptive tuning parameter selection, which may be the case when using an existing (validated) model. In many cases, however, analysts have to select between multiple models or perform a data-adaptive search through a parameter space for tuning parameter selection when developing a prediction model \cite{steyerberg_clinical_2019}. To avoid overfitting, analysts typically use methods such as cross-validation or the bootstrap to perform selection. These techniques rely on optimizing some measure of model performance, such as the MSE.

When performing model or tuning parameter selection for counterfactual prediction, the results from the previous sections suggest that the model performance measure should be targeted to the counterfactual performance if the intervention of interest were universally applied. For example, when using cross-validation for model selection the analyst splits the data into $K$ mutually exclusive ``folds'' and fits the candidate models using $K - 1$ of the folds and estimates the performance of each in the held out fold. This process is repeated $K$ times where each fold is left out once. The final performance estimate is the average of the $K$ estimates and the model with best overall performance is selected (or, alternatively, the tuning parameter with the best performance). When performing counterfactual prediction, at each stage in the procedure the analyst should use modified performance measures such as those in section \ref{sec:performance} above. Failure to do so, can lead to sub-optimal selection with respect to the counterfactual prediction of interest. 

%\section{Time-varying treatments} \label{sec:time-varying}

\section{Simulation experiments} \label{sec:simulation}
We performed two Monte Carlo simulation experiments to illustrate (i) the benefits of tailoring models to the correct counterfactual estimand of interest, (ii) the potential for bias when using na\"{i}ve estimators of model performance such as the MSE, (iii) the importance of correct specification of the nuisance models when estimating counterfactual performance, and (iv) the properties of the doubly-robust estimator under misspecification of the nuisance models. We adapt data generation processes previously used for transporting models between settings under covariate shift \cite{steingrimsson_transporting_2023, morrison_robust_2022}.

\subsection{Experiment 1}
We simulated treatment initiation at baseline based on the logistic model $\Pr[A=1 \mid X]=\operatorname{expit} (1.5-0.3 X)$, where predictors $X$ are drawn from $X \sim$ Uniform $(0,10)$. Under this model, about 50\% initiate treatment but those with higher values of $X$ are less likely to start treatment than those with lower values of $X$. We then simulated the outcome using the linear model $Y=1+X+0.5 X^2- 3A + \varepsilon$, where $\varepsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, X)$.  We set the total sample size to 1000 and the data were randomly split in a 1:1 ratio into a training and a test set. In this simulation, $X = X^*$. The full process may be written:
\begin{align*}
    X & \sim \text{Unif}(0, 10) \\
    A & \sim \text{Bernoulli}\{\operatorname{expit}(-1.5 + 0.3 X)\} \\
    Y & \sim \text{Normal}(1 + X + 0.5 X^2 - 3 A, X)
\end{align*}    
 
Our goal was to estimate a model in the same population where, contrary to fact, treatment was universally withheld, i.e. we targeted $\E[Y^{a=0} \mid X]$. Note that, for simplicity, in this case predictor variables are the same set necessary to control confounding $X = X^*$. Under this data generating mechanism, the MSE under no treatment is larger than the MSE under the natural course and identifiability conditions 1-3 are satisfied. We considered two specifications of prediction models $\mu_{\beta}(X)$:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item a correctly specified linear regression model that included the main effects of $X$ and $X^2$, i.e. $\mu_{\beta}(X) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \beta_2 X^2$.
    \item a misspecified linear regression model that only included the main effect of $X$, i.e. $\mu_{\beta}(X) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X$.
\end{enumerate} 
For each specification, we also considered two estimation strategies: one using ordinary least squares regression (OLS) and ignoring treatment initiation and the other using weighted least squares regression (WLS) where the weights were equal to the inverse of the probability of being untreated. As discussed above the latter specifically targets the counterfactual estimand under no treatment. Finally, we considered two approaches for estimating the performance of the models in the test set: a na\"{i}ve estimate of the MSE using observed outcome values, i.e. 
$$\widehat{\psi}_{Na\ddot{i}ve}(a) = \frac{1}{n_{test}} \sum_{i=1}^n I(D_{test,i} = 1) (Y_i - \mu_{\widehat{\beta}}(X_i))^2,$$ 
and the inverse-probability weighted estimator $\widehat{\psi}_{IPW}(a)$ from section \ref{sec:performance}. For the latter, we fit a correctly specified logistic regression model for $e_a(X)$, i.e. $e_a(X) = \operatorname{expit}(\alpha_0 + \alpha_1 X)$, in the test set to estimate the weights. Lastly, we also calculated the ``true'' MSE under intervention to withold treatment by generating test data under same process as above but setting the treatment $A$ to $a = 0$ for everyone and then averaging across simulations.

        \item \noindent Correct and misspecified refers to the specification of the  prediction model $\mu_\beta(X)$.

        \end{tablenotes}
        \end{threeparttable}
    
\end{table}

Table 1 shows the results of the experiment based on 10,000 simulations. In general, correctly specified models yielded smaller average MSE than misspecified models. Comparing the performance of OLS and WLS estimation, when using $\widehat{\psi}_{Na\ddot{i}ve}(a)$, the na\"{i}ve estimator of the MSE, OLS seemed to produce better predictions than WLS when correctly specified (average MSE of 2.9 vs. 5.5) as well as when misspecified (average MSE of 16.8 vs. 19.5). In contrast, when using $\widehat{\psi}_{IPW}(a)$, the inverse-probability weighted estimate of the MSE, WLS performed better than OLS both when the model was correctly specified (average MSE of 1.0 vs. 3.6) and when misspecified (average MSE of 15.0 vs. 17.5). For reference, in the last column we show the true counterfactual MSE that would be obtained if one had access to the potential outcomes (obtained via numerical methods). We found that the average of the inverse probability weighted estimator across the simulations was equivalent to this quantity for all specifications and for both OLS and WLS estimation. This suggests that only the modified estimators of model performance in section \ref{sec:performance} are able to accurately estimate the counterfactual performance of the model. Indeed, under this data generation process, if one were to use the na\"{i}ve estimator one might erroneously conclude that the OLS model is the better choice.


\subsection{Experiment 2}

In the previous experiment, we assumed the nuisance models for the MSE were correctly specified. We now consider estimation of model performance in the more likely case that nuisance models are misspecified. Using the results from Section \ref{sec:auc} in the Appendix, we also estimate the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC). We simulated treatment initiation over follow up $A$ based on the logistic model $\operatorname{Pr}[A=1 \mid X]=\operatorname{expit}(0.5 - 2 X_1 + 3 X_1^2 + 2 X_2 - X_3)$, where $X$ is now a vector of predictors drawn from a 3-dimensional multivariate normal with mean vector $\mu = (0.2, 0, 0.5)$ and covariance matrix $\Sigma = \text{diag}(0.2, 0.2, 0.2)$. This resulted in expected treatment initiation over follow up of 55\%. We also simulated a binary outcome from a Bernoulli distribution with mean $\operatorname{expit}(0.2 + 3 X_1 - 2 X_1^2 + 2 X_2 + X_3 - 2 A)$, implying an average probability of the outcome of 66\% among the untreated and 32\% among treated. Again, we set the total sample size to 1000 and randomly split the data in a 1:1 ratio into a training and a test set. 
\begin{align*}
    X & \sim \text{MVN}(\mu, \Sigma) \\
    A & \sim \text{Bernoulli}\left\{\text{expit}\left(0.5 - 2 X_1 + 3 X_1^2 + 2 X_2 - X_3\right)\right\} \\

\end{align*}

Our prediction model was a main effects logistic regression model fit in the training data, i.e. $\mu_\beta\left(X^*\right) = \operatorname{expit}(\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \beta_3 X_3)$. This model was misspecified with respect to the true data generating process. We assessed the counterfactual performance of the model in an untreated population using the AUC and the MSE, which for a binary outcome is equivalent to the Brier score \cite{brier_verification_1950}. In general, positing a parametric model for $h_0(X)=\mathrm{E}[(Y-g\left(X^*\right))^2 \mid X, A=0]$ may be difficult as the outcome is a squared difference. For binary outcomes, however, expanding the square shows that to estimate $h_0(X)$ it is enough to estimate $\operatorname{Pr}[Y=1 \mid X, A=0]$, which is the approach we used. To determine the effect of the specification of nuisance models $e_a(X)$ and $h_a(X)$ on performance estimates, we compared four estimators of AUC and MSE (${\psi}_{Na\ddot{i}ve}(0)$, ${\psi}_{IPW}(0)$, ${\psi}_{CL}(0)$, and ${\psi}_{DR}(0)$) using different combinations of correctly specified and misspecified models for $e_a(X)$ and $h_a(X)$:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Correct $e_a(X)$ - main effects logistic regression model with linear and quadratic terms.
    \item Misspecified $e_a(X)$ - main effects logistic regression model with linear terms only terms.
    \item Correct $h_a(X)$ - main effects logistic regression model with linear and quadratic terms.
    \item Misspecified $h_a(X)$ - main effects logistic regression model with linear terms only terms.
\end{enumerate}
Finally, we also considered using more flexible estimation techniques for nuisance terms $e_a(X)$ and $h_a(X)$. Specifically, we fit generalized additive models for both using the \texttt{mgcv} package in $\mathrm{R}$ entering all covariates as splines using the default options in the \texttt{gam} function.

Table 2 shows the results from experiment 2. As in the previous experiment, the na\"{i}ve empirical estimators of the AUC and MSE were biased relative to the true counterfactual values with a relative bias of 2.1\% and $-5.4\%$ respectively. When all models were correctly specified, the weighting, conditional loss, and doubly robust estimators were all unbiased (absolute relative bias between 0.2\% to 0.3\%). When $e_a(X)$ was misspecified, the weighting estimator was biased (relative bias of 4.7\% and -2.8\%) but the conditional loss and doubly robust estimator were unbiased (absolute relative bias of 0.2\% to 0.3\%). Under misspecification of $h_a(X)$, the conditional loss estimator was biased (relative bias of 2.9\% and -0.9\%), but the weighting estimator and the doubly robust estimator were unbiased (absolute relative bias of 0.0\% to 0.3\%). When both models $e_a(X)$ and $h_a(X)$ were misspecified all estimators, including the doubly robust estimator, were biased. Finally, when a more flexible generalized additive model was used to estimate both $e_a(X)$ and $h_a(X)$, the doubly robust estimator was unbiased (absolute relative bias of 0.1\%). Across all scenarios, the weighting estimator generally had the largest standard errors and the conditional loss estimator had the smallest standard errors.

\section{Application to prediction of statin-na\"{i}ve risk} \label{sec:results}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We apply the proposed methods to evaluate the performance of two counterfactual prediction models targeting the statin-na\"{i}ve risk of cardiovascular disease: that is the risk in the same population if, contrary to fact, statins had been withheld. We compare one model that was explicitly tailored for the counterfactual estimand of interest and a second that was not. 

\subsection{Study design and data}
The Multi-Ethnic Study on Atherosclerosis (MESA) study is a population-based sample of 6,814 men and women aged 45 to 84 drawn from six communities (Baltimore; Chicago; Forsyth County, North Carolina; Los Angeles; New York; and St. Paul, Minnesota) in the United States between 2000 and 2002. The design, sampling procedures, and collection methods of the study have been described previously \cite{bild_multi-ethnic_2002}. Study teams conducted five examination visits between 2000 and 2011 in 18 to 24 month intervals focused on the prevalence, correlates, and progression of subclinical cardiovascular disease. These examinations included assessments of lipid-lowering medication use (primarily statins), as well as assessments of cardiovascular risk factors such as systolic blood pressure, serum cholesterol, cigarette smoking, height, weight, and diabetes. 

In a previous analysis, we used data from the MESA study to emulate a trial comparing continuous statin use versus no statins and benchmarked our results against those from published randomized trials. To construct a model of the statin-na\"{i}ve risk, we then emulated a single arm trial in which no one started statins over a 10-year follow up period. To determine trial eligibility, we followed the AHA guidelines \cite{grundy_scott_m_2018_2019} on statin use which stipulate that patients aged 40 to 75 with serum LDL cholesterol levels between 70 mg/dL and 190 mg/dL and no history of cardiovascular disease should initiate statins if their (statin-na\"{i}ve) risk exceeds 7.5\%. Therefore, we considered MESA participants who completed the baseline examination, had no previous history of statin use, no history of cardiovascular disease, and who met the criteria described in the guidelines (excluding the risk threshold) as eligible to participate in the trial. The primary endpoint was time to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), defined as nonfatal myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease death, or ischemic stroke. 

Follow up began at the second examination cycle to enable a ``wash out'' period for statin use and to ensure adequate pre-treatment covariates to control confounding (some were taken from the first cycle and others from the second). In the original analysis, we constructed a sequence of nested trials starting at each exam, however here for simplicity we limited our attention to the first trial. We used the questionnaire in examinations three through five to determine statin initiation over the follow up period. Because the exact timing of statin initiation was not known with precision, we estimated it by drawing a random month between the current and previous examinations (sensitivity analyses conducted in original study).

Of the 6,814 MESA participants who completed the baseline examination, 4,149 met the eligibility criteria for our trial emulation. There were 288 ASCVD events and 190 non-ASCVD deaths. For simplicity, here we dropped those lost to follow up and who first have competing events although in practice both can be accommodated in our framework for evaluating the performance of a counterfactual prediction model. For model training and evaluation, we further randomly split the dataset into training and test sets of equal size. 

\subsection{Model estimation and performance}

We compared two prediction models: one that was explicitly tailored to the statin-na\"{i}ve risk and a second that was not. Both models used the same regression specification with main effects of baseline predictors commonly used in cardiovascular risk prediction: age, sex, smoking status, diabetes history, systolic blood pressure, anti-hypertensive medication use and total and HDL serum cholesterol levels.

We tailored the first model for the statin-na\"{i}ve risk using inverse probability of censoring weights. In the emulated single arm trial, statin initiation can be viewed as ``non-adherence'' which can be adjusted for by inverse probability weighting, therefore we censored participants when they initiated statins. To calculate the stablized weights, we estimated two logistic regression models: one for the probability of remaining untreated given past covariate history (denominator model) and one for probability of remaining untreated given the selected baseline predictors (numerator model). The list of covariates in the weight models are given in section \ref{sec:covs} of the Appendix. To create a prediction model for the statin-na\"{i}ve risk, we used the estimated weights to fit a weighted logistic regression model conditional on the baseline predictors of interest. 

For comparison, we fit a second traditional (factual) prediction model by regressing the observed ASCVD event indicator on the same set of baseline predictors, but ignoring treatment initiation over the follow up period. This approach targets the ``natural course'' risk (i.e., the risk under the statin initiation policies that prevailed at the time of the study) rather than the statin-na\"{i}ve risk. We fit the model using standard logistic regression based on maximum likelihood.

To assess the performance of the models, we estimated the na\"{i}ve and counterfactual MSE in the test set. For the latter we used the conditional loss, inverse probability weighting, and doubly robust estimators of the MSE. Models for the initiation of treatment $e_a(X)$ and for the conditional loss $h_a(X)$ were implemented as main effects logistic regression models. As in the simulation example, to estimate the conditional loss it is sufficient to model the probability of the outcome alone. To quantify uncertainty, we used the non-parametric bootstrap with 1000 bootstrap replicates.

\subsection{Results}

Table 3 shows estimates of the AUC and MSE and the associated standard errors in a hypothetical statin-na\"{i}ve population for both prediction models using the na\"{i}ve empirical, conditional loss, weighting, and doubly robust estimators. Across both measures, the conditional loss, weighting, and doubly robust estimators yielded estimates that were greater (30-50\% for MSE, 3-10\% for AUC) than those of the na\"{i}ve empirical estimator, suggesting performance of both models in statin-na\"{i}ve population is worse than in the source population. Of the three estimators of the statin-na\"{i}ve performance, the weighting estimator had greater standard errors than the doubly robust estimator (by 10-100\%) as well as the conditional loss estimator (by 60-160\%). Consistent with the first simulation experiment, the inverse probability weighted logistic model, which was tailored to target the statin-na\"{i}ve risk, performed worse in the source population, but had lower MSE and higher AUC values in the counterfactual statin-na\"{i}ve population. There were sizeable differences (2-3 standard errors) in estimates of the MSE and AUC in the counterfactual statin-na\"{i}ve population across the proposed CL, IPW, and DR estimators. All three should give equivalent results in expectation if models for the nuisance functions $h_a(X^*)$ and $e_a(X^*)$ are correctly specified. Their divergence suggests at least one (but possibly both) of the nuisance functions may be misspecified. Finally, drawing on the results in section \ref{sec:calib} in the appendix, we estimate the counterfactual calibration of both prediction models in a statin-na\"{i}ve population using a weighted loess estimator where the weights are based on inverse probability of remaining statin free. Figure \ref{fig:calib} shows the results. As expected, the weighted prediction model, which was tailored to target the statin-na\"{i}ve risk, was better calibrated than the unweighted model, which generally underestimated the counterfactual risk.

\section{Discussion} \label{sec:discussion}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Many practical prediction problems call for the development and evaluation of counterfactual prediction models, for example, when the treatment distribution changes between the time training data are obtained and when the model will be deployed, or when predictions are meant to inform decisions about treatment initiation. In this paper, we considered the setting when the counterfactual prediction model has to be developed using observational training data. We described how to estimate counterfactual prediction models and the conditions necessary to identify these models. Separately, we also discussed how to adjust common measures of model performance to estimate the performance of counterfactual prediction model. Importantly, results for performance measures were valid even when the prediction model is misspecified. A key insight was that performance measures that have not been tailored for counterfactual prediction will be biased. We also showed that performance can be assessed even if the prediction model itself is misspecified. We proposed estimators for these performance measures based on modeling the conditional loss, the probability of treatment, and a doubly robust estimator that can be used with data-adaptive estimators of either nuisance function. 

We focused on measures of performance under a particular treatment policy. However, prediction models may instead target the estimation of conditional treatment \textit{effects}, that is, comparisons between treatment regimes such as $\tau(X^*) = \E[Y^1 - Y^0 \mid X^*]$. In some cases, effects may be easier to communicate to end users or may be desirable to evaluate benefits versus harms of treatment initiation \cite{kent_predictive_2020}. However, absolute means and risks are common outputs of existing prediction models. Several authors have proposed model performance measures for conditional average treatment effects which are identified under similar assumptions to our own \cite{schuler_comparison_2018, rolling2014model, xu_calibration_2022, van2003unified, alaa_validating_2019}. From an estimation standpoint, methods for targeting the conditional average treatment effect and their performance have to balance the estimation of the conditional risk function for the outcome under different treatment levels with the estimation of the treatment effect function, with optimality depending on the relative smoothness of these functions.

Throughout, we did not assume that the covariates needed to satisfy the exchangeability assumption were the same covariates used in the prediction model. This is an important aspect of our work because in practice predictors are often chosen based on their availability in a clinical setting rather than what would be optimal from a causal (or even predictive) perspective \cite{steyerberg_clinical_2019, }. Moreover, our methods reflect the fact that confounding is a problem that needs to be adjusted for in the setting where the model is developed, whereas predictions often need to be optimized for the setting where the model will be applied (although as discussed below allowing the covariate distribution to differ between settings can introduce further subtleties).

One limitation of our approach is that it require that a set of covariates sufficient to ensure exchanageability can be identified at the time of training the model. Violations of this exchangeability condition can be examined in sensitivity analyses \cite{robins_sensitivity_2000,steingrimsson_sensitivity_2023}, for example, to explore how violations of this assumption might affect estimates of model performance. Further work may also examine identification of counterfactual prediction models and their performance under alternative identifiability conditions.

In this work, we assumed that the distribution of predictors is the same in the training and deployment setting. In many cases, however, the covariate distributions are also likely to differ between settings \cite{bickel_discriminative_2009, sugiyama_covariate_2007}. Like differences in treatment initiation, differences in covariate distributions may cause the performance of the prediction model to degrade, particularly when the model is misspecified. Methods for transporting prediction models from source to target populations which relate to our own have previously been proposed \cite{sugiyama_covariate_2007,bickel_discriminative_2007,sugiyama2012machine, steingrimsson_transporting_2023, li_estimating_2022, morrison_robust_2022} as have methods for transporting conditional average effects from trials to target populations with different covariate distributions \cite{mehrotra_transporting_2021, seamans_generalizability_2021, robertson_estimating_2021, robertson_regression-based_2023}. In future work, our results could be extended to allow for both differences in the distribution of treatment $f(A|X)$ and the covariates $f(X)$ between training and deployment settings.
