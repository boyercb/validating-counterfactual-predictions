Counterfactual prediction methods are required when a model will be deployed in a setting where treatment policies differ from the setting where the model was developed, or when the prediction question is explicitly counterfactual. However, validating counterfactual prediction models is challenging because one does not observe the full set of potential outcomes for all individuals. We consider methods for validating a counterfactual prediction model. We discuss how to tailor a model to a counterfactual estimand, how to assess the model's performance, and how to perform model and tuning parameter selection. We also provide identifiability results for measures of counterfactual performance for a potentially misspecified prediction model based on training and test data from the same (factual) source population with the same covariate distribution. Last, we illustrate the methods using simulation and apply them to the task of developing a statin-naive risk prediction model for cardiovascular disease. \\
